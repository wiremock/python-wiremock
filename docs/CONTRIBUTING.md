All patches to the repository are done via pull requests.
No special prerequisites exist, you can just submit the patches!
General expectations:

- All Tests and static checkers must pass
- Code coverage shouldn't decrease

## Development

We use [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for packaging and dependency management.

run the following command to setup the project:

`uv sync`

Then use your favorite IDE for development and testing.

## Contributing examples

Please submit new examples as a pull requests to the
[examples directory](https://github.com/wiremock/python-wiremock/tree/master/examples). 
You can also also add links to external examples and tutorials to the `README.md`
file in the directory.

When adding new examples,
make sure to update the [documentation site page](./examples.md) too.

## Working on Documentation

The documentation is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/).
All the necessary dependencies are included into the pyproject definition.
To build the docs locally:

```bash
uv run mkdocs build --site-dir=html
```

MkDocs also comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it by running the `mkdocs serve` command.
By default, it will deploy the live documentation site to `http://localhost:8000`.
