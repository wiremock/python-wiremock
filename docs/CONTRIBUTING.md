## Get Started

1. Join us ion the `#wiremock-python` channel on the [WireMock Slack](https://slack.wiremock.org/)
2. Check out the GitHub issues!

## Pull Requests

All patches to the repository are done via pull requests.
No special prerequisites exist, you can just submit the patches!
General expectations:

- All Tests and static checkers must pass
- Code coverage shouldn't decrease
- All Pull Requests should be rebased against master **before** submitting the PR.
- The Pull Request titles represent the change well for users or developers

## Development

We use **VSCode Dev Containers** for development.

If you'd like to contribute:

1. Follow [this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) to set up Dev Containers.
2. Once set up, open the `python-wiremock` folder in VSCode.
3. Use the **Dev Containers** extension to reopen the project inside the container.

That's it - you'll have a ready-to-use development environment.

## Contributing examples

Please submit new examples as a pull requests to the
[examples directory](https://github.com/wiremock/python-wiremock/tree/master/examples). 
You can also also add links to external examples and tutorials to the `README.md`
file in the directory.

When adding new examples,
make sure to update the [documentation site page](./examples.md) too.

## Working on Documentation

The documentation is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/).
All the necessary dependencies are included into the pyproject definition.
To build the docs locally:

```bash
uv run mkdocs build --site-dir=html
```

MkDocs also comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it by running the `mkdocs serve` command.
By default, it will deploy the live documentation site to `http://localhost:8000`.
